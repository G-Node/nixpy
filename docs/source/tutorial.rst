NIXPy Tutorial

In the following you will find some tutorials showing how to use nixpy
to read and write nix-files. All code can be found in the examples
folder.

Working with Files
==================

The following code shows how to create a new nix-file, close it and
re-open them with different access rights (examples/fileCreate.py).

Storing data
============

In this section we will show how different kinds of data are stored in
nix files. We will start with simple regularly and irregularly sampled
signals, turn to series of such signals and end with images stacks.


.. _regularly_sampled_data:

Regularly sampled data 
"""""""""""""""""""""" 

Regularly sampled data is everything which is sampled in regular
intervals in space, time, or something else. Let's consider a signal
that has been digitized using an AD-Converter at a fixed sampling
rate. In this case the axis representing time has to be described
using a **SampledDimension**. This dimension descriptor contains as
mandatory element the *sampling_interval*. The *sampling_interval* has
to be given because it also applies e.g. to spatial sampling, it is
the more general term than the sampling rate which may appear
appropriate for time discretization. Further, the *unit* in which this
number has to be interpreted and a *label* for the axis can be
specified. The following code illustrates how this is stored in nix
files.

.. literalinclude:: examples/regularlySampledData.py

.. image:: examples/regular_sampled.png

.. _irregularly_sampled_data:

Irregularly sampled data
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Irregularly sampled data is sampled at irregular intervals. The
dimension which is sampled in this way has to be described using a
**RangeDimension**. This dimension descriptor stores besides the
*unit* and *label* of the axis the ticks, e.g. time-stamps of the
instances at which the samples were taken.

.. _multiple_signals:

Series of signals
"""""""""""""""""

It is possible to store multiple signals that have the same shape and
logically belong together in the same *DataArray* object. In this
case, the data is two-dimensional and two dimension-descriptors are
needed. Depending on the layout of the data one dimension represents
time and is described with a *SampledDimension* while the other
represents the various signals. This is described with a
*SetDimension*. A *SetDimension* can have labels for each entry along
this dimension of the data.

.. literalinclude:: examples/multipleTimeSeries.py

.. image:: examples/multiple_time_series.png
	   :width: 120


.. _image_data:

Image data
""""""""""""

Color images can be stored as 3-D data in a *DataArray*. The first two
dimensions represent *width* and *height* of the image while the 3rd
dimension represents the color channels. Accordingly, we need three
dimension descriptors. The first two are *SampledDimensions* since the
pixels of the image are regularly sampled in space. The third
dimension is a *SetDimension* with labels for each of the channels.
In this tutorial the "Lenna" image is used. Please see the author

Tagging regions
===============

One key feature of the nix-model is its ability to annotate, or *tag*,
points or regions-of-interest in the stored data. This feature can be
used to state the occurrence of events during the recording, to state
the intervals of a certain condition, e.g. a stimulus presentation, or
to mark the regions of interests in image data. In the nix data-model
two types of Tags are discriminated. (1) the **Tag** for single points
or regions, and (2) the **MultiTag** to annotate multiple points or
regions using the same entity.
