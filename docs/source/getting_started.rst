This introduction guides through the *NIX* data model and shows how to use it with the `nixio python library <https://github.com/g-node/nixpy>`__.


In the following we provide an introduction to the general concepts of the *NIX* data model, try to illustrate its design principles and provide code examples showing the usage of the `python <https://github.com/g-node/nixpy>`__ library for reading and writing *NIX* files.

Code examples use the python library but almost all functions have direct counterparts also in the `C++ library <https://github.com/g-node/nix>`__ or the language bindings to this for `Matlab <https://github.com/g-node/nix-mx>`__ and `java <https://github.com/g-node/nix-java>`__. 

---------------

Most code examples are standalone and you should be able to run them. The code is also available from the `project repository on GitHub <https://github.com/G-Node/nixpy/tree/master/docs/source/examples>`_.
