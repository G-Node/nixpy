Idea
====

The basic idea of the *NIX* project is to come up with a **generic**
data model that defines as few structures/entities as possible while
being able to represent a multitude of different data structures, allows
for in-depth annotation and supports standardization.

Designing a **generic** data model implies that the defined entities are
named in a way that may seem uncommon but are more general than the
*domain-specific* terms used in any given field or community.


Please follow this link to the `C++ nix library documentation <https://nixio.readthedocs.io/en/master/data_model.html>`_ to lear more about the data model. 

The idea of the *NIX* data model has been implemented using the
`HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org>`__ file format.
